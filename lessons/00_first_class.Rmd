# Welcome!

This first class will be pretty light on the R, but it is necessary for us to get to know each other and to make sure everyone is ready to jump in when we get rolling next week.  Today we will:

- Go over the course details including where to find all the materials, schedule details, etc.
- Do a round of introductions
- First crack at RStudio and installing a package
- The kids and pets rule

# Homework

1. Between now and next class, please be sure to have completed the following:
  - Open up RStudio
  - Install the "Tidyverse" meta-package with `install.packages("tidyverse")
  - This will take a little while to install, so be patient.
